As A Windows User Who Has Switched Full Time To Linux, Appimages Are Amazing, I Love Them And Have Decided To Make A Repo Of Appimages I've Made For Others To Use
Appimages Are Great For Portable Applications, I Wanted To Make Some 32-Bit Software For Linux As Everyone Knows That 32-Bit Linux Users Are Really Hurting In That Field
And Due To My Personal Love For Appimages I've Made The Last 32-Bit Linux Version Of LZDoom, And ZDoom As Appimages, They Should Hopefully Just Work, I Haven't Tested Them
On A 32-Bit Machine, But They Work Well On My Distro, If Anyone Has Issues Running Them On 32-Bit I'll Remake Them On A 32-Bit Version Of Linux
